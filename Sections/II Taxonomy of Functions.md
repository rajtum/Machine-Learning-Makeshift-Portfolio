# II. Taxonomy of Functions
## Pr√©cis
*The method of documentation presented in this section is more a creative flourish than an essential read. Conventional documentation can be found on any method below with the* `help` *command or in the function's code as docstring and commented code. The premise of this section is to seek to classify and explicate the functions within this portfolio by the looking at the functions through the prism of taxonomy.*
## Author's Note
*Please note in biological taxonomic classifications, only the genus (first letter capitalized) and species (not capitalized) is italicized to identify an organism in a system called binomial nomeclature. Here, trinomial nomenclature with adapted classifications, format typography, and abbreviations will be used to classify and explicate functions and attendant "ecosystems." Function "ecosystems" represented a group of functions that worked in a synergistic fashion and each section of code within this portfolio was designated its own "ecosystem." While a whimsical liberty was taken in the naming of "ecosystems," some more apropos than others, these names should not be impediment to comprehension and do not serve any special purpose beyond continuing the environmental-taxonomical biologist lens of expounding. This is not an exhuastive list of all functions but rather a strategic collection of functions that may be most confusing at first glance and/or with synergistic functionality.*

## A. Adaptations

### i. Classifications
* `Family Genus Species`
  * Some families have *prefices* in addition to the root name
    * For instance, within the family `comparison`, there are the three prefixes `time_`, `opt_`, and `multi`, which can be concatenated
* Trinomial Nomenclature
### ii. Format Typography
* Will not be italicized
* Will be formatted as code like this: `code`
* Capitalization will be determined by the individual names rather than collective ranks
### iii. Abbreviation
* Will not follow *Genus species* becomes *G. species*
* Instead, `Family Genus Species` becomes `F.G.Species`
* **Important Truncation Rules:**
  * Capitalization will follow rule declared in ii. Format Typography
    * i.e. `Family genus SPECIES` becomes `F.g.SPECIES`
  * Underscores and special characters will be ignored in abbreviation
    * i.e. only the first letter will be used in abbreviation
  * First letter of the prefix will be appended with a hyphen to the conventional abbreviation
    * i.e. multicomparison_plot_surface_Forest with prefix `multi` abbreviates to `m-c.p.Fo`
  * If there is no `Genus`, abbreviation, standard abbreviation rules still apply
    * i.e. `Family Species` becomes `F.Sp` like the function `initialize_DT` which abbreviates to `i.DT`
    * Though irksomely illogical in context of biology taxonomical paradigm which inspired its conception, the rule enables classification of more functions at the sake of introducting a systemics depravity.
  * **Conflict Clause**: In the event that the same abbreviation will be used for two or more distinct functions, then the `Genus` will be appended to these function one letter at a time until no two functions have the same abbreviation.
    * i.e. `for_3D_plot_Forest` and `for_3D_comp_Forest` respectively become `f.3Dp.Fo` and `f.3Dc.Fo`
  * **Hypothetical but Extended Conflict Clause**: Athough no instance occurs where the aforementioned conflict clause enumerating the `Genus` letter by letter does not fail to distinguish multiple function's abbreviations, if such example were to occur theoretically, then the `Family`, `Species`, and `Prefix` in that order would be enumerated in the same fashion until the same aim of unique abbreviations for each function is accomplished. This rule would most likely be called upon in circumstances where there is the function has no `Genus` and would ergo seldom apply.

## B. Family
### `experiment`
* Collects data for hyperparameter optimization
---
### `for_`
* Converts data from `experiment` family to plottable data
---
### `plot`
* Plots a static `pyplot` with what is returned from `for_` family

### `interactive`
* Plots an interactive `plotly` with what is returned froom `for_` family
---
### `comparison`
* Compares or generates comparison data for two datasets in a `plot`, `interactive`, `DataFrame`, etc.
* There are three prefices which modify the family's function:
#### Prefices 
`multi`
* Strictly for plotting, enables comparison of up to five datasets

`time_`
* Meant to represent data from `comparison_Forest` to either a graphical or tabular format

`opt_`

---
### `optimize`
* Finds the parameters of the model that had the lowest mean absolute error with data from the family `experiment`
---
### `initialize`
* Creates an object specifed in the `Species` based on desired parameters

## C. Genus

### Family of `experiment`
