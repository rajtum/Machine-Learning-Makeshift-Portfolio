## To View Sections III-VII
For reasons explained in [How to Explore](https://github.com/rajtum/Machine-Learning-Makeshift-Portfolio/blob/master/README.md#how-to-explore) of `README.md` at repository's homepage, the `.ipynb` viewer on Github sometimes throws an error, so here are the Google Colab share links:

This will open a `.ipynb` with all the input and output loaded for you without having to run a single cell. If you try to run a cell, it will first ask you to sign in (if you are not signed in) and then whether you trust the block of code. All of this is explained with visuals and details in [How to Explore](https://github.com/rajtum/Machine-Learning-Makeshift-Portfolio/blob/master/README.md#how-to-explore) of `README.md` at repository's homepage.
